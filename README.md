## Want to find all relevant documents?
HiCAL is a system for efficient high-recall retrieval. The system allows retrieving and assessing relevant documents and provides high data processing performance and a user-friendly document assessment interface.

---
Our model was evaluated on the standard TREC dataset: TREC Core 2017 Track and
TREC Core 2018 Track.

Visit [hical.github.io](https://hical.github.io/) for usage and
installation instruction.  For component specific details, check the README in
their respective directory.
